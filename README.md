<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

CureOCD is an application that implements the ERP steps, that is a subtype of CBT, to induce anxiety provoking effects in patients and then provide a virtual therapy to reduce the obsessions that result in creating anxiety.Our application contains the functionality of YBOCS test that is a standard test to diagnose the OCD severity level. On the basis of this test patients are exposed to specific environment. This project aims to develop a prototype that would give an experience based on a comparable reality like the one the patient is familiar with, challenging their Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in a controlled environment and urging the patient to dissimulate their compulsions.

Here's why:
* Virtual reality (VR) is the most immersive technology utilized for symptom provocation in OCD because it removes the actual world’s distractions.
* Limited trained specialists
* Prohibited cost of treatment
* Specific reasons to people with OCD such as fear of exposure and uneasiness in recognizing in obsessions.


The future goal of this project is to fully develop the conceptualized application and make it available to mental health professionals, to justify and incentivize the
use of VR for therapy in other areas as more than just entertainment. In near future VR could assist standardized clinical training in exposure therapy, making training easier and more accessible. Therapists could practice with virtual patients repeatedly while mastering clinical evaluation and exposure therapy skills in a VR training environment. Comfort and skill with exposure therapy will enable therapists in offering evidence-based treatment and alleviating patients’ fears of the therapy.
